# Airsoft-Masochism
How to build your own

Note: In its current state this code is the crappiest thing that you can imagine. It barely works, and one time locked up and shot me 30 times. Please help me improve it!

## Python Code

The Python code takes care of reading the health meter in fortnite and sending an HTTP request to the ESP8266. To run this code, simply run CV2.Py
Currently, all other files in the "Python" file are for testing only.

## Arduino Code

The arduino code sets the ESP8266 up as an HTTP server. This allows you to send it commands that turn on and off an LED (reused code) that also controls a relay.
By controlling the duration that the relay is on, single shots, burst, or more can be fired.

# PLEASE DO NOT TRY WHAT YOU SEE HERE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

I am not responsible for any harm this code/guide may cause. I took the risk of making it knowing full well that there is serious risk of injury, and that major precautions should be put in place to emphasize safety.
